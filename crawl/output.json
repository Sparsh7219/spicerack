Note: Save adding salt until the end of cook time.", "COVER WITH HOT WATER:  Cover beans with hot water from your jug or kettle just until fully covered.

Repeat until you get the desired consistency.", "ADD:  Add salt by half-teaspoon until you reach the level of your liking.  It may not take much for you.  Also add a bit more fresh ground pepper.", "NOW:  Put your rice on to cook.

The reason I don't do that is because I don't want to lose any of my beans, though I do that if I make a double batch. These freeze so well (without rice).  Also, for re-heating, I put beans in a pot on the stove (medium/low) and add small amounts of water to thin them out a bit. They are much better juicy! The beans are very forgiving but they do need that added moisture when being re-heated.

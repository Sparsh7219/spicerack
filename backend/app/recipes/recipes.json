      "Rub spice mixture evenly over the pork, store any extra spice rub in an airtight container with the rest of your spices. You can cook the pork right away but ideally marinate the pork in the spice rub for 4 hours or even overnight.",
      "Preheat oven to 250 degrees F. Place a long piece of foil across a half sheet tray so there is some hanging off both sides. Then place another long piece of foil going in the opposite direction. Place the seasoned pork, fat side up, in the center of the foil and toss to coat with the olive oil. Tightly cover the pork with the foil, keeping the foil seam on the top. Place in the oven and cook for 3 hours. Remove the pork from the oven and carefully open the foil pack so the top is exposed but so that the foil is still catching the juices released from the pork. Place the pork back in the oven and cook an additional 2 \u00bd - 3 hours or until the pork is tender and easily shreds with a fork. Remove from the oven and turn on the broiler.",
      "To make the BBQ sauce: While the pork is cooking make the BBQ sauce. Drain the dates and chiles from the warm water once they have softened. Add chilies to the sauce based on your spice preference. Place all the ingredients in a blender and blend on high until the sauce is smooth and shiny. Season with salt and remove to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to serve.",
      "To make the Whole30 mayo: Place the yolks, mustard, lemon juice and garlic in a blender and blend on high until smooth and combined. With the blender running slowly stream in the oil until the mixture emulsifies and forms mayonnaise. Season to taste with salt. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to serve. You can use it right away but I like to serve it the next day after the garlic has flavored the mayo.",
      "To make the coleslaw: In a large bowl combine the cabbages, fennel, apple, red onion, parsley, lemon juice and vinegar. Fold in enough mayo to lighten the coleslaw in color and give a creamy taste, up to a \u00bc cup. Taste and season with salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.",
      "To serve: Top the pork with 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce and place under the broiler for 4-5 minutes or until the sauce has caramelized. Remove from the oven and shred the pork into bite sized pieces. Toss the pork with more of the BBQ sauce. Serve the remaining BBQ sauce on the side with the coleslaw.",

Roll to make an 8\u201d poli using dry flour to dust as needed. When sufficiently rolled, dust off excess flour.",
      "Heat a shallow nonstick pan on medium-high heat. When ready to place a Puran poli in the pan, turn it down to medium heat. The side that hits the pan first is the first side. Watch the dough bubble slightly and move it around in the pan without flipping it over. Turn the Puran poli over approximately 1 minute later. The first side should be lightly spotted but not have dark spots. If this happens too quickly, reduce the heat. Repeat on the second side, and while the second side cooks, lightly baste the first side of the with ghee. Using a spatula, flip the paratha and repeat the basting. Both sides should have ghee\u2014cooked once without ghee and once with ghee. Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel or a colander to help the steam evaporate. Once they have come to room temperature, the Puran Poli can be transferred to an appropriate storage container."

Moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. The white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. A foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. The butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. When the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. Decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. If you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot.",
      "Making the Scented Syrup: Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add rose water or essence.",
      "Traditional Method: Use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. Use a non-stick pot if you have it. Boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring,  until it forms a paste.  Add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. Oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside.",
      "Powdered-Milk Method: Combine the warm milk and ghee together. Mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough. Oil your hands and form uniform balls (about 24) and set aside on a buttered plate.",
      "This is the most delicate part of the operation. Gentle, low heat is a must. Use a wok or karai for best results, with the ghee about 2.5-3 inches in depth.",
      "Heat the ghee on low to 215 degrees.",
      "Slip in the balls, one by one. They will sink. No touching at this point.",
      "Gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. After about 5 minutes they will begin to float. You will notice them getting bigger.",
      "Now, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning.",
      "The ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook.",
      "After about 20 minutes, the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden.",
      "Remove a ball and put it in the syrup. If it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes, remove the others and add to the syrup.",
      "If it does collapse, fry for another 5 minutes and try again.",
      "Let soak for 2 hours at least before serving.",
      "Serve room temperature or warmed up.",
      "Enjoy your gulab jamuns!"

      "3) Prep the chicken - take skins off if you bought chicken with the skin on. Rinse the chicken with water and pat dry. Create slits in the pieces randomly with a knife so that the spices can get into the meat.",

NOTE RE SPICES: we never measure these spices, but ratios help. For this part of the recipe, smaller amounts of each chili powder, cumin, and turmeric are fine - let's say one spoon of each, more of the chili powder if you want it spicy.",

      "6) Once you start smelling the whole spices, add the rest of your onion/garlic/ginger paste. Cook until the paste starts to take on a slightly reddish color. Add larger amounts of the spices now. I will do two generous shakes of the chili powder (I like my curries spicy), one shake of ground cumin, and one shake of turmeric. If it looks too brown, I will add some turmeric and chili powder because I want it to be a little brighter.",

      "8) After 20 minutes, check the pot to see if any liquid has come out. This is the curry! If it looks dry, add some a couple cups of hot water to the pot, but only if it looks totally dry. Stir the chicken and recover the pot, lower the heat a little more, and let it all simmer/stew together for another 20 minutes.",
      "9) 15 minutes into the second 20 minutes, add the Thai chilies. Make sure they are washed. If you want more of the heat to come out of the chilies, make one diagonal slit in each chili. Adding the chilies is optional.",
      "10) At the end of the 20 minutes, check your pot. There should be ample curry. Give it all a final stir and check the chicken to make sure it is all cooked through. It should be by now, but you can never be too careful! Have some cooked rice handy and serve with some saag bhaji (another recipe!). This recipe is easy to scale up or down and if you have leftovers, you can eat this up to 4 days after you make it, at least."

Remove from the heat and cool (it will continue to thicken as it cools). Cover and chill until ready to serve. If desired, unmold the panna cotta. Serve with the cherry compote either on top or alongside."

Tear chiles into flat pieces and toast a few at a time, pressing them against the hot surface, until they crack and blister; flip them and press down again. Transfer chiles to a large bowl and cover with boiling water; weight down with a plate to keep them submerged, and soak at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roast the garlic in the same griddle or skillet, turning frequently, until soft inside and blackened outside, about 15 minutes. Cool and peel. Drain chiles, reserving 3/4 cup soaking liquid; put chiles into a blender with garlic, cloves, sesame seeds, vinegar, cumin, peppercorns or ground pepper, and salt. Process/blend until mixture is smooth; then strain through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Remove 1/2 cup of mixture to a small bowl, and stir in the sugar; set aside to use for the final glazing.",

Cut a double thickness of heavy-duty foil to cover the roasting pan; place the pan lid over, making sure the pan is covered as tightly as possible. Bake 4 hours.",

Measure out the broth into a 1-quart container; add water to equal 1 quart liquid if necessary, and pour into a saucepan. Puree the tomato in a blender and add it to the broth along with the oregano and cinnamon. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat 45 minutes. Season with salt.",
      "GLAZE THE MEAT: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove meat from the bones, keeping pieces of meat as large as possible; discard bones, gristle and excess fat. Set meat on a baking sheet; brush lightly with reserved chile paste glaze, and bake 10 minutes to set the glaze.",

      "Preparing the cornhusks. Cover the husks with very hot water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and let stand for a couple of hours until the husks are pliable.",
      "Preparing the filling: On a baking sheet, roast the tomatillos about 4 inches below a very hot broiler until soft (they\u2019ll blacken in spots), about 5 minutes; flip them over and roast the other side. Cool and transfer to a food processor or blender, along with all the delicious juice that has run onto the baking sheet. Add the chiles and garlic and process to a smooth puree. Heat the oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium high. When quite hot, add the puree all at once and stir until noticeably thicker and darker, about 5 minutes.(I cover the pot with a splatter screen)  Add 2 cups of the broth and simmer over medium heat (I use high heat)  until thick enough to coat a spoon quite heavily, at least 10 minutes. I keep it simmering while I shred the chicken. (If you are making a double batch of the recipe, make sure to cook the filling for a longer amount of time.) Taste and season highly with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. Stir in the chicken and cilantro; cool completely.",
      "Preparing the batter: With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the lard or shortening with 2 teaspoons salt and the baking powder until light in texture, about 1 minute. Continue beating as you add the masa (fresh or reconstituted) in three additions. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add 1 cup of the remaining broth. Continue beating for another minute or so, until a \u00bd-teaspoon dollop of the batter floats in a cup of cold water (if it floats you can be sure the tamales will be tender and light). Beat in enough of the remaining \u00bd cup of broth to give the mixture the consistency of soft (not runny) cake batter; it should hold its shape in a spoon. Taste the batter and season with additional salt if you think it needs some. For the lightest textured tamales, refrigerate the batter for an hour or so, then rebeat, adding a little more broth or water to bring the mixture to the soft consistency it had before.",
      "For forming the tamales, separate out 24 of the largest and most pliable husks\u2014ones that are at least 6 inches across on the wider end and 6 or 7 inches long. If you can\u2019t find enough good ones, overlap some of the large ones to give wide, sturdy surfaces to spread the batter on. Pat the chosen husks dry with a towel.",
      "Forming the tamales. Cut twenty-four 8- to 10-inch pieces of string or thin strips of cornhusks. One at a time, form the tamales: Lay out one of your chosen cornhusks with the tapering end toward you. Spread about \u00bc cup of the batter into about a 4-inch square, leaving at least a 1 \u00bd-inch border on the side toward you and a \u00be-inch border along the other sides (with large husks, the borders will be much bigger). Spoon about 1 \u00bd tablespoons of the filling down the center of the batter. Pick up the two long sides of the cornhusk and bring them together (this will cause the batter to surround the filling). If the uncovered borders of the two long sides you\u2019re holding are narrow, tuck one side under the other; if wide, roll both sides in the same direction around the tamal. (If the husk is small, you may feel more comfortable wrapping the tamal in a second husk.) Finally, fold up the empty 1 \u00bd-inch section of the husk (to form a tightly closed \u201cbottom\u201d leaving the top open), and secure it in place by loosely tying one of the strings or strips of husk around the tamal. As they\u2019re made, stand the tamales on their folded bottoms in the prepared steamer. Don\u2019t tie the tamales too tightly or pack them too closely in the steamer. They need room to expand.",
      "Setting up the steamer. Steaming 24 husk-wrapped tamales can be done in batches in a collapsible vegetable steamer set into a large, deep saucepan. To steam them all at once, you need something like the kettle-size tamal steamers used in Mexico or Asian stack steamers, or you can improvise by setting a wire rack on 4 coffee or custard cups in a large kettle. It is best to line the rack or upper part of the steamer with leftover cornhusks to protect the tamales from direct contact with the steam and to add more flavor. Make sure to leave tiny spaces between the husks so condensing steam can drain off.",
      "Steaming and serving the tamales: When all the tamales are in the steamer, cover them with a layer of leftover cornhusks; if your husk-wrapped tamales don\u2019t take up the entire steamer, fill in the open spaces with loosely wadded aluminum foil (to keep the tamales from falling over). Set the lid in place and steam over a constant medium heat for about 1 \u00bc hours. (depending on the size of the tamales you make, it can take up to 4 hours). Watch carefully that all the water doesn\u2019t boil away and, to keep the steam steady, pour boiling water into the pot when more is necessary. Tamales are done when the husk peels away from the masa easily. Let tamales stand in the steamer off the heat for a few minutes to firm up. For the best textured tamales, let them cool completely, then re-steam about 15 minutes to heat through."

If using shrimp, fill a saucepan with salted water and bring to a boil. Add the shrimp, cook until pink and beginning to curl, about 3 minutes, then drain. When cool enough to handle, slice each in half lengthwise.  Add the shrimp to the vinegar mixture and marinate up to 1 hour. If using crabmeat and/or surimi, marinate in the vinegar mixture as well.",
      "Cut the cucumber in half crosswise, then cut into paper-thin matchsticks 1\u20132 inches long. Cube the avocados, place in a bowl, and toss with rice vinegar to prevent browning. Have ready a bowl of ice water. Blanch the snow peas in boiling water for 1 minute, drain, immerse in the ice water, drain again, and slice diagonally into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.",
      "ln a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or chopsticks until well blended. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar and a pinch of salt and stir until the sugar dissolves. In a 10-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, warm the oil. When the oil is hot, pour in the egg mixture and swirl to cover the bottom of the pan. Cook, gently lifting the edges to let the uncooked egg flow underneath, until the bottom is set but not browned and the top is relatively dry, 4\u20135 minutes. Carefully slide the eggs out of the pan onto a flat plate and blot with a paper towel. Let cool, then cut into fine bite-sized shreds called kinshi tamago (shredded omelet topping). Set aside.",
      "To prepare the mushrooms, in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, combine 2 cups water, the soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the mushrooms and cook until the liquid is greatly reduced and the mushrooms are thoroughly flavored but not burned, 15\u201320 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely in the liquid, then remove from the liquid and thinly slice them. Set aside.",
      "Meanwhile, prepare the sushi rice: In a small saucepan over low heat, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt and stir until the sugar and salt are dissolved. Place the hot cooked rice in a large shallow bowl, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the warm vinegar mixture evenly over the hot rice and, using a wooden rice spatula or wooden spoon, mix in the vinegar, repeatedly cutting down into the rice, turning it over to season it evenly, and mixing until well combined. Let cool to room temperature.",
      "Mix the mushrooms into the cooled rice, distributing them evenly, and divide the rice mixture among 4 bowls. Divide evenly and decoratively arrange the seafood, omelet shreds, salmon (if using), cucumber, avocado, and snow pea toppings on the rice and garnish with yakinori and sesame seeds. Serve at room temperature (chilling hardens the rice) with small individual bowls for soy sauce and wasabi (if using) into which to dip the toppings.",

Vegetarian maki rolls are fabulous and can include carrot (shavings or fine sticks), avocado (thinly sliced), cucumber (thinly sliced lengthwise, small Mediterranean cucumbers are best with lower water content than English cucumbers), sesame seed (dry-toasted), spring onion (green onion or scallion), sweet red, orange or yellow pepper (pimento, finely sliced lengthwise), firm juicy-fleshed fruit such as strawberry and melon, and of course wasabi and Japanese Kewpie Doll mayonnaise.",

Rinse it, swirl it again and drain again and again.  Scrunch the rice about in the bowl with your hands while rinsing it --  this should take 3 or 4 attempts. Transfer the rinsed rice into a large saucepan.  Pour in 3 and 1/3 cups of water and leave it to soak for at least 30 minutes.  As it soaks the rice will become whiter and water clear.",

Heat gently and stir to ensure that the sugar and salt dissolve.  Don't let the mixture boil as it will impair the flavor.  Only heat long enough to dissolve.  Let it cool while you prepare the rice.",
      "Step 3.  COOK THE RICE.  Put the lid securely on top and turn the heat to high.  Avoid lifting the lid at all times through out the cookin process as this will allow the steam to escape. When the rice begins to boil, reduce the heat and leave it to simmer for 15 minutes.  After the fifteen minutes are up, turn off the heat and leave the rice to stand for another 15 minutes.",
      "Step 4.  STIR IN THE SUSHI VINEGAR.  Transfer rice into a large wooden bowl.  *I use a glass one and it works fine* Pour the cooled sushi vinegar over the rice.  Use a flat spatula in a cutting motion to fold the mixture into the rice.  While you are folding, use your other hand to fan the rice.  You want to bring that rice to room temperature while folding.",
      "Step 5.  READY TO SERVE.  It's best to use the rice immediately.  It should be shiny and sticky, with each grain separated and not mashed together. It should be used at room temperature.  If you don't need it straight away, cover the bowl with a damp cloth.  This will prevent it from becoming to hard.",

      "Remove the lid then mix the rice. Let it cool until you can hold the rice at the palm of your hands. While waiting for the rice to cool, you can cook the shio-kombu filling.",

      "Start by wetting your hands with water. It would be helpful if you prepare a bowl of water and a clean towel near you when making onigiri. The water will prevent the rice from sticking to your hands while the towel can be used to wipe your hands.",
      "Spoon out about a handful of seasoned rice and put it at the top of the palm of your hands.",
      "Put about a teaspoon of the shio kombu in the middle then press the rice so the filling will be covered with rice in the middle. You can form a ball-like shape onigiri with the shio kombu filling in the middle.",
      "Use one palm of your hand to support the base of the onigiri. The other hand will help to shape the onigiri into a somewaht-traingular shape. Press firmly but not too much. Just enough so that the onigiri will hold its shape and will not break. Do not press firmly as the rice might become hard when the rice ball cools down completely.",
      "Cut out a rectangle from the nori sheet big enough so that it will reach the middle part of each side of the rice ball holding the base. Press the nori sheet onto the rice ball then wait for it to stick with the rice then you can serve."

Return the skillet to medium-low heat on the stovetop and cook until the caramel darkens in color evenly, 20 to 25 minutes. Keeping your heat on medium-low will ensure that your caramel doesn't burn and cooks evenly.",

Place a plate or platter larger than the skillet right on top. Carefully (but with gusto!) flip the tart upside-down onto the plate. If the apples stick to the skillet, carefully remove them and put them back where they belong on the tart.",

Sear your pork loin on all sides so that it gets a nice golden orange color on it. Immediately remove the pork roll, wrap in plastic wrap tightly and then another layer of foil. Cool to room temperature and then place in the refrigerator to cool overnight. The next day it is ready to slice and eat."

      "PREPARE RICE: Cook rice as directed (this can be done the day before). Dice a 1/2 red pepper and 1/4 cup red onion. Put in a container and add 1 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro or 1 tsp dried cilantro. Store container in fridge until ready to fry rice (this can be done the day before).",

Lay one slice of meat over the crumbs, sprinkle more bread crumbs on top and pound into meat using a meat mallet (or make a fist and pound with the side of your hand).

Place a few slices of meat in skillet and cook about 1.5 minutes or until edges become golden brown and meat actually lifts up in the center.

(TIP: Make sure skillet has cooled before adding eggs - you don't want them to cook too fast or the egg whites will become hard before the yolks are cooked). Add eggs individually so they remain separate and fry just until yolks are cooked, flipping once. Serve immediately.",

It will cook down later and intensify but use this opportunity to check the flavor. If needed, add up to 1\u00bd teaspoons sugar or fish sauce, or both. Set aside.",
      "In a skillet or sauteuse pan over medium heat, melt the coconut oil. When the oil is barely shimmering, add the shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 4 minutes, until the garlic is pale blond. Remove from the heat and, once the cooking action subsides, add the coconut water mixture.",
      "Return the skillet to high heat and bring to a boil. Cook, without stirring, for 10 to 14 minutes, until reduced to between \u2153 and \u00bd cup, a bit thickened, and slightly darkened. Add the shrimp and continue cooking at a swift simmer, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the shrimp curls up and cooks through and the sauce is slightly syrupy. (Expect the shrimp\u2019s natural juices to release, thin out, and flavor the sauce.) If the shrimp cooks too fast, remove it from the pan, let the sauce cook down, and then return the shrimp. Remove from the heat, season with lots of pepper, and stir in the green onion. Let sit for 5 minutes for the flavors to settle and deepen.",
      "Transfer the shrimp to a shallow bowl or plate and serve.",
      "This key Viet ingredient is simply nearly burnt sugar; it\u2019s not at all the caramel sauce for topping ice cream. Vietnamese caramel sauce is stealthily employed in savory dishes to impart a lovely mahogany color and build savory-sweet depth. You\u2019ve likely had caramel sauce in clay-pot (kho) dishes but didn\u2019t know it. Like molasses, it can be added to grilled-meat marinades to enhance the appearance of the final dish.",
      "Don\u2019t fear the caramelization process. It\u2019s not overly dramatic, and the vinegar prevents crystallization, which can result in crusty failed batches. Employ cane sugar, such as C&H brand, because it caramelizes consistently better than beet sugar. The result is an inky, bittersweet Vietnamese staple. I keep a jar of caramel sauce to cut down on prep work. If you don\u2019t have time to make a batch, use the work-arounds in the recipes to make some on the spot. Select a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan with a long handle and a light interior (such as stainless steel) to observe the caramelization. If you wish, use strained fresh lemon or lime juice in place of vinegar.",
      "Fill the sink (or a large bowl or pot) with enough water to come halfway up the sides of the saucepan.",
      "In the saucepan, combine the 2 tablespoons water, vinegar (if using), and sugar. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring with a heatproof spatula or metal spoon; when the sugar has nearly or fully dissolved, stop stirring. Let the sugar syrup bubble vigorously for 5 to 6 minutes, until it takes on the shade of light tea. Turn the heat to medium-low to stabilize the cooking. Turn on the exhaust to vent the inevitable smoke. (Don\u2019t worry if sugar crystallizes on the pan wall. But if things get crusty in the bubbling sugar syrup, add another drop of vinegar to correct it.) For even cooking, you may occasionally lift and swirl the saucepan.",
      "Cook the syrup for about 2 minutes longer, until it is the color of dark tea. The next 1 to 2 minutes are critical because the sugar will darken by the second. Monitor the cooking and, to control the caramelization, frequently pick up the saucepan and slowly swirl the syrup. When a dark reddish cast sets in\u2014think the color of Pinot Noir\u2014let the sugar cook a few seconds longer to a color between Cabernet and black coffee. Remove from the heat and place the pan in the water to stop the cooking. Expect the pan bottom to sizzle upon contact.",
      "Leaving the pan in the sink, add the remaining \u00bc cup water. The sugar will seize up, which is okay. When the dramatic bubbling reaction stops, return the pan to medium-high heat, and cook briefly, stirring to loosen and dissolve the sugar.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and return to the water in the sink for about 1 minute, stirring, to stop the cooking process and cool the caramel sauce to room temperature.",
      "Use the sauce immediately, or transfer to a small heatproof glass jar, let cool completely, and then cap and store in a cool, dark place indefinitely."

If you don't have ancho chile powder, you shouldn't substitute it with cayenne or regular chile powder because it won't taste the same. Cayenne will add a lot of heat, as will regular chile powder, and there's plenty of heat already in the Frank's Hot Sauce. If you don't have ancho, you can try smoked spanish paprika.  Or if you really feel up to experimentation, you can try a couple drops of Liquid Smoke and regular mild (not hot) paprika or a little chile powder, making sure that you taste it as they're added gradually to get the amount of heat and smokiness you prefer."

If you are accustomed to baking recipes with 18.25-ounce mixes, there is a simple way that you can add flour to the smaller mixes and still bake Cake Mix Doctor recipes. Pour the cake mix into a large bowl and whisk in 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour. Now proceed as the recipe instructs. Not only will the cake achieve good volume, but it will have a nice structure and slice evenly. I learned this trick years ago before the mixes were downsized. If I added a little flour to the cake mix, then the cake seemed to have more body, and it did not sink or shrink when cooling. I hope you enjoy this simple solution!"

If the strips you\u2019re using aren\u2019t wide enough to span 5x5 inches, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern. Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with.",
      "The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave. (BBQ Addict recommends Bad Byron's Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlen's All-Purpose Rub).",
      "Now that your pork is well seasoned, it\u2019s time to add more pork. Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave. Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across. Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like.",
      "Next up is bacon layer number two. Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast. If you like soft bacon, make it soft. If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy.",
      "Since this is a barbecue recipe, we need to add another layer of barbecue flavor. Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces. (BBQ Addict recommends Burnt Finger BBQ\u2019s homemade competition sauce). Once you\u2019ve sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbecue seasoning you used on the bacon weave.",
      "Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards. You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll. Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed. Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside.",
      "At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but we\u2019re missing one key item. To complete the construction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave. Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up.",
      "Sprinkle some barbecue seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now it is ready for the smoker. Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225\u00b0F in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your meat thermometer gives an internal temperature reading of 165\u00b0F Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek. BBQ Addict recommends  2.5 hours, for a roll 2.5 inches in diameter.",
      "Now that the Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, you need to add some finishing flavors. Remember that barbecue sauce you used for inner flavor? You'll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave. Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce. Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so they\u2019ll give your fatty a nice glossy finish. Spicy and vinegar based sauces don\u2019t contain as much, so they won\u2019t set up as well. If you\u2019re dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and you\u2019ll get the same effect.",
      "Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve. If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.",

For 1:1 simple syrup, add equal parts sugar and hot water, seal, and shake until dissolved. Let cool before using and store for up to several weeks in the fridge. For 2:1 simple syrup, mix two parts sugar to one part hot water and proceed as above. Easy-peasy.",

These are then blended into buttermilk to create a savory marinade. More seasoning is then added to the flour in the dredging mixture, and finally, the hot little nuggets of chicken are topped with crunchy fried curry leaves and chile peppers. While we often eat this with a hot sauce or ranch dressing, the very best accompaniment is the maple-vinegar syrup or green chutney."

Be sure you're also choosing cheeses that will hold up to being cut and skewered. My favorites for this are: your favorite cheddar, a simple brie that isn't too runny at room temp, a goat gouda, and a blue like fourme d'ambert. Cube all your cheese.",

      "To kick off the construction of this pork medley you\u2019ll need to create a 5x5 bacon weave. If the strips you\u2019re using aren\u2019t wide enough to span 5x5 inches, then you may need to use a few extra slices to fill out the pattern. Just make sure your weave is tight and that you end up with a nice square shape to work with.",
      "The next step is to add some barbecue seasoning on top of your bacon weave. (BBQ Addict recommends Bad Byron's Butt Rub, Rendezvous Famous Seasoning, or Steven Raichlen's All-Purpose Rub).",
      "Now that your pork is well seasoned, it\u2019s time to add more pork. Take two pounds of Italian sausage and layer it directly on top of your bacon weave. Be sure to press the sausage to the outer edges of the bacon creating a patty that is the same thickness all the way across. Most grocery stores carry loose sausage, so just pick out one you like.",
      "Next up is bacon layer number two. Take the remaining bacon slices and fry them up the same way you would for breakfast. If you like soft bacon, make it soft. If you like crunchy bacon, make it crunchy.",
      "Since this is a barbecue recipe, we need to add another layer of barbecue flavor. Take your favorite sauce and drizzle it all over the top of the bacon pieces. (BBQ Addict recommends Burnt Finger BBQ\u2019s homemade competition sauce). Once you\u2019ve sauced the bacon, sprinkle on some more of the barbecue seasoning you used on the bacon weave.",
      "Very carefully separate the front edge of the sausage layer from the bacon weave and begin rolling backwards. You want to include all layers EXCEPT the bacon weave in your roll. Try and keep the sausage as tight as possible and be sure to release any air pockets that may have formed. Once the sausage is fully rolled up, pinch together the seams and ends to seal all of the bacon goodness inside.",
      "At this point we can start to see the final shape of our Bacon Explosion, but we\u2019re missing one key item. To complete the construction process, roll the sausage forward completely wrapping it in the bacon weave. Make sure it sits with the seam facing downward to help keep it all sealed up.",
      "Sprinkle some barbecue seasoning on the outside of the bacon weave, and now it is ready for the smoker. Cook your Bacon Explosion at 225\u00b0F in a constant cloud of hickory smoke until your meat thermometer gives an internal temperature reading of 165\u00b0F Normally this will take about 1 hour for each inch of thickness, but that could vary depending on how well you maintain your fire and also how many times you open the smoker to take a peek. BBQ Addict recommends  2.5 hours, for a roll 2.5 inches in diameter.",
      "Now that the Bacon Explosion is fully cooked, you need to add some finishing flavors. Remember that barbecue sauce you used for inner flavor? You'll be using that same sauce to glaze the cooked bacon weave. Using a basting brush, coat the entire surface with a thin layer of sauce. Sweet sauces are loaded with sugars, so they\u2019ll give your fatty a nice glossy finish. Spicy and vinegar based sauces don\u2019t contain as much, so they won\u2019t set up as well. If you\u2019re dead set on using those sauces, just cut them with a bit of honey and you\u2019ll get the same effect.",
      "Slice the Bacon Explosion into quarter to half inch rounds to serve. If your roll was good and tight, you should now see a nice bacon pinwheel pattern throughout the sausage.",
      "Obviously pork is best served by itself, but if you feel the need to make this meat monster into a sandwich, BBQ Addict recommends  placing a couple Bacon Explosion slices on a warm Pillsbury\u2019s Grands Biscuit."

Total mixing/kneading time should be no more than 2 - 3 minutes (This step can also be done in a mixer with a dough hook in 1 - 2 minutes. If it looks smooth, but doesn\u2019t form a ball, just take it off the hook and form into a ball).",
      "Place the dough in a bowl (or keep it in your mixing bowl), lightly oil/spray the dough ball.",
      "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in a warm place. Let the dough rise for 1 to 2 hours (or until dough has doubled).",

      "ASSEMBLING YOUR PIZZA AND BAKING: Place a pizza stone in the bottom rack of your oven and place a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil across the top rack. Preheat your oven to 500 degrees (F). It should take about 40 minutes to an hour to preheat your stone, so you may want to do this while your dough is rising. If you refrigerated your dough, take it out of the fridge while your oven is preheating.",

      "Lightly grease the bottom (not the sides) of your pan with oil or high-heat cooking spray.",
      "Press out the dough in the pan from center to the edge, as flat and even as possible. Pinch up the sides into a paper-thin lip about 1 to 1-1/2 inches high.",
      "Lightly press sliced mozzarella cheese into the dough, overlapping the slices until the entire bottom is covered (If making an all-cheese pizza, you can add extra cheese if you want, then skip to the part where you add the tomatoes).",
      "Add the Italian sausage: For traditional patty, add small bits of sausage on top of the cheese, connecting the bits together into a loose web, until the entire bottom is covered.",
      "Add any other ingredient that you want to protect from burning.",
      "THE PART WHERE YOU ADD THE TOMATOES: With a large spoon or ladle, top the pizza with the crushed tomatoes, spreading the sauce from the center out to the edge until the other ingredients are completely covered with sauce. You should need between 14 and 16 oz of tomatoes.",
      "Sprinkle grated Romano (and/or Parmesan) Cheese over the top of the sauce.",
      "Turn oven down to 450 and place the pizza pan directly on top of the pizza stone on the lower rack.",
      "Bake for approximately 35 minutes. If your crust or toppings start to char on top, place a loose sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the pizza for the remaining baking time.",
      "Remove from oven, let pizza rest for 5 minutes, then cut & serve on a real plate with a knife & fork."

If you are accustomed to baking recipes with 18.25-ounce mixes, there is a simple way that you can add flour to the smaller mixes and still bake Cake Mix Doctor recipes. Pour the cake mix into a large bowl and whisk in 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour. Now proceed as the recipe instructs. Not only will the cake achieve good volume, but it will have a nice structure and slice evenly. I learned this trick years ago before the mixes were downsized. If I added a little flour to the cake mix, then the cake seemed to have more body, and it did not sink or shrink when cooling. I hope you enjoy this simple solution!"

Strain the gravy into a clean saucepan and add the remaining 1 cup of stock. In a small bowl, mix the flour with 1/4 cup of cold water until smooth. Whisk flour mixture into warm gravy, and let simmer, whisking constantly to prevent lumps, until thickened slightly, about 3-5 minutes. Add the cream and season with salt and pepper.",

Maybe 25 % fat, ( I recommend 1 lb of ground venison, and 1/2 lb of deer sausage for fat content), otherwise your results will be poor. I don't know about some of the other game meat some are using. Please consult an expert. The recipe is delicious as it stands! Enjoy! Nita Holleman."

Just use your own best judgement as to a good consistency, as this recipe is hard to mess up.

      "2.Some of you Polacks (and I say that lovingly, because I am part Litvak (Lithuanian)) out there are scoffing at the fact that it has cooked cabbage in the center and cheese on top --  But hey, it works. The cheese gets nice and golden brown and lovely and the cabbage in the meat mixture is just sublime.",
      "3.I have made the meat mixture by making instant rice. 1 cup of uncooked instant rice is far more than 1 cup after you cook it. If you do this, it just makes more of the mixture and after 10 rolls I had enough mixture to set aside and freeze for another glorious Polish day in my household."

Rather than just using 1 packet, use 2 packets of the beef flavor ramen noodles. When cooking the noodles, cook them without the flavoring. During this time, (after you drain the ground beef) add the veggies to the meat and continue to cook. As the veggies become cooked, add the two packets of flavoring to the beef-veggie mixture. The ramen noodles don't take long to cook, so be sure to watch them. When they are done, drain them, and add them to the beef-veggie mixture.
